// Exercise 1: Calculate the Sum of Two Numbers

1) Use variables VAR1, VAR2, and SUM
2) Capture input for VAR1, VAR2
3) Add input for VAR1, VAR2 to SUM
4) Show result of SUM


// Exercise 2: Check if a Number is Even or Odd

1) Input number
2) If Number % 2 equals 0, Output "Your number is even."
3) Else, Output "Your number is odd."


// Exercise 3: 
Write pseudo code that will perform the following    

a) Read in 5 separate numbers.   
b) Calculate the average of the five numbers.
c) Find the smallest (minimum) and largest (maximum) of the five entered numbers.
d) Write out the results found from steps b and c with a message describing what they are

// Read Input for NUM1,NUM2,NUM3,NUM4,NUM5
// Add NUM1-NUM5, place results as SUM
// Modulo SUM by 5 for average, and display results as "AVERAGE"
// Set NUM1 as MIN, set NUM5 as MAX
// If results is < NUM1, Then set as "MIN"
// If results is > NUM5, Then set as "MAX
